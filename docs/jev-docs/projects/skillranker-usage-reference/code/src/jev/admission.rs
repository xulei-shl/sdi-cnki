//! Invocation-wide provider attempt admission, permits, and cost receipts.
//!
//! Under the SkillRanker contract (I03, `sr-roadmap-l1i.2.8`), fresh calls to
//! TypeSafe's Jev inference service are strictly bounded:
//! - Default budget: 2 logical requests (Stage 1 Wide, Stage 2 Rerank) and at most
//!   4 HTTP attempts total across retries.
//! - Single admission seam: every attempt (including retries, evaluation batches,
//!   and breaker probes) must acquire a single-use [`AttemptPermit`] before transmission.
//! - Single-use permits: each permit binds an [`AttemptId`], target origin, guard
//!   generation, monotonic deadline, and stage. A permit is consumed at most once.
//! - Known vs. unknown usage: when a response arrives, exact returned token counts are
//!   accumulated into [`CostReceipt`]. If an attempt times out, cancels, or fails
//!   *after* bytes are put on the wire, an unknown-usage marker is recorded.
//!   Unknown provider cost is never counted as zero.
//! - Cancellation before send: permits discarded before network transmission consume
//!   an attempt slot but record zero unknown tokens.
//! - Cache zero-cost path: exact cache hits bypass provider admission entirely and
//!   produce a [`CostReceipt::zero_cost_cache_hit`].
//! - Stage exhaustion: if attempt budget is exhausted before or during rerank,
//!   rerank admission is refused. The wide winner is never promoted as rerank.
//! - Operational refusal: budget/breaker refusals return [`AdmissionRefusal`] mapped to
//!   `unavailable / request-budget` (exit code 4), distinct from relevance abstentions.
